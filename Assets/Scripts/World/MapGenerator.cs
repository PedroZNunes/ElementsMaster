    // There are a few ways I can think of how to do this.
    // 1 - I can place each block and check if the player can reach that block.
    // 2 - I can place entire platforms of many blocks and see if the player can get there. if Not I can try to reposition the platform
    // 3 - I can place platforms first and then i can add smaller chunks of blocks for items and jump puzzles.
    // i have to study this.
